              <p> Having surveyed the options, I decided on WordPress for its great flexibility, low ongoing costs as well as being well paired with the client’s previous knowledge of CMS interfaces. This gave me the opportunity to learn basic PHP, whilst further developing my front-end coding skills.</p>
              <p> The resulting backend was an intuitive experience for the client - using tags and custom fields to organise the content. The website itself was built largely as a single page application - providing fluid navigation for users.</p>

Effectively a SPA, with all content Because the client wanted an easily editable backend and had worked with WordPress before. I hadn’t made a Wordpress site before - making the project a challenge. Used feedback from the client to determine the best solution… whilst it may have been tempting to use a web service such as Squarespace, the ongoing fees were a concern.

              Crucial to James’ vision for the website was a desire to be presented with equal weight as both an academic and practicing architect. This lead me to a design with a flat hierarchy. Wanting to provide an immersive, smooth user experience I hard coded the site — eliminating Page loads by loading content dynamically. In order to achieve this careful detail had to be taken throughout the build, ensuring the website was lightweight enough to work as a single page application. The resulting website is one which is at once challenging and rewarding — standing out from the norm to provide a distinct voice to James’ practice.
