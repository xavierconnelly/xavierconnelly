              The website would be the main point of contact for the client. I made a Wordpress site. Effectively a SPA, with all content Because the client wanted an easily editable backend and had worked with WordPress before. I hadn’t made a Wordpress site before - making the project a challenge. Used feedback from the client to determine the best solution… whilst it may have been tempting to use a web service such as Squarespace, the ongoing fees were a concern. The project required me to learn basic PHP to setup the backend. It was designed by Alex, with input and collaboration from me. From Alex’s initial concepts we collaborated, finding the right balance , turning her designs into engaging web interfaces. The finished result is a unique web interface which neatly presents the information whilst giving a strong brand identity for the client.
